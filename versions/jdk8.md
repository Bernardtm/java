JSR 335, JEP 126: Language-level support for lambda expressions (officially, lambda expressions; unofficially, closures) under Project Lambda[203] and default methods (virtual extension methods)[204][205][206] which allow the addition of methods to interfaces without breaking existing implementations. There was an ongoing debate in the Java community on whether to add support for lambda expressions.[207][208] Sun later declared that lambda expressions would be included in Java and asked for community input to refine the feature.[209] Supporting lambda expressions also enables functional-style operations on streams of elements, such as MapReduce-inspired transformations on collections. Default methods allow an author of an API to add new methods to an interface without breaking the old code using it. Although it was not their primary intent,[204] default methods also allow multiple inheritance of behavior (but not state).
